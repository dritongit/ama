## 🌍 What is AMA?

**AMA** is a hybrid civic-tech manifesto and open-source project, launched in January 2022 by Driton Haxhiu.  
Its goal is to merge personal freedom, digital technology, and European identity into a civic framework designed to resist nationalism, propaganda, and ideological isolation.

## 🔟 Ten Pillars of AMA

1. **European Identity & Individual Freedom**  
   We are not East – we are civilization. AMA is a return to the European self within us.  
   We empower individuals, not state structures.

2. **Nationalism is the Virus of the Century**  
   We fight nationalism as a root cause of wars and ideological decay.  
   AMA is openly anti-authoritarian and anti-nationalist.

3. **The European Union as a Historical Mission**  
   Not just for visas – but for a unified future.  
   Kosovo is not the edge, it is the soul of Europe.

4. **Technology & Artificial Intelligence**  
   Open Source, APIs, Transparency.  
   Our future is AI-powered but human-guided. We call this bond: `connect’`.

5. **Ecology & the Cell**  
   Clean water, living rivers, and the biology of sustainability.  
   Civilization starts with the cell – and ends where nature dies.

6. **Education & Critical Thinking**  
   Education must liberate, not indoctrinate.  
   We believe in decentralization – 100 small labs are better than one ministry.

7. **Economy for the Individual**  
   Lower taxes, boost innovation.  
   The free market is not the enemy of equality – it’s the cure for poverty.

8. **Security Without Fear**  
   Fight organized crime, ideological sabotage, and digital warfare.  
   Kosovo’s safety starts with transparency.

9. **Traditional Values + Modern Freedom**  
   We honor family and roots, while defending personal freedom and dignity.  
   There is no war between the past and the future – there is only balance.

10. **Rilindje Without Violence**  
    We don’t fight with guns – we fight with code, clean ideas, and collective action.  
    AMA is a civic evolution: Right-wing in economy, liberal in spirit, and clean in mission.
